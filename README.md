## 🔧 KeyAuth Integration

The KeyAuth system provides a secure method for managing user accounts. Here’s how to set it up:

1. **Create a KeyAuth Account**: Sign up at the KeyAuth website.
2. **Get Your API Key**: Once registered, obtain your API key from the dashboard.
3. **Configure the API Key**: Insert your API key into the configuration file within the project.

### Example Code Snippet

Here’s a simple example of how to authenticate a user using KeyAuth:

```csharp
using KeyAuth;

public class AuthService
{
    private KeyAuthAPI keyAuth;

    public AuthService(string apiKey)
    {
        keyAuth = new KeyAuthAPI(apiKey);
    }

    public bool Login(string username, string password)
    {
        return keyAuth.Login(username, password);
    }
}
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

The Elite Premium Loader allows extensive customization. You can change colors, fonts, and animations to create a unique experience. 

### Changing Colors

Modify the color settings in the configuration file:

```json
{
    "backgroundColor": "#000000",
    "textColor": "#FFFFFF"
}
```

### Adding Fonts

To add custom fonts, place your font files in the `fonts` directory and update the configuration:

```json
{
    "font": "MyCustomFont.ttf"
}
```

## 🕹️ Animation Support

Animations enhance the user experience. You can implement various animations for the loader and menu. Here’s a basic example of a fade-in effect:

```csharp
private void FadeIn()
{
    this.Opacity = 0;
    var fadeInAnimation = new DoubleAnimation
{
        To = 1,
        Duration = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)
    };
    this.BeginAnimation(UIElement.OpacityProperty, fadeInAnimation);
}
```
